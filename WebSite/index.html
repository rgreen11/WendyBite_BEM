                <section>The series revolves around four older,
                    women (three widows and one
                    ivorcée) sharing a house in Miami,
                    Florida. The owner of the house is a widow
                    named Blanche Devereaux (Rue
                    McClanahan), who was joined by fellow
                    widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and
                    divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur).
                    They both responded to a room-for-rent
                    ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery
                    store. In the pilot episode, the women ha
                    a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin)
                    who was subsequently removed.[5] The
                    three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty),
                    after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.[67][7]</section>
